This is some documentation for the NYT API lucene syntax used for searching through the fq-field.
(query in config file).

The default fields are body, headline or byline. That is: if no specifying field:word/phrase is 
entered, the word/phrase is searched for in body, headline and byline.

The boolean operators used to combine terms are OR (default), AND, AND NOT and (+/-).
