This is an interface to the NYT and Guardian APIs.
The program gets data from these APIs, and writes it to csv-files in the "dyads"-
folder. This data will eventually be analyzed in interesting ways!

Will eventually form the input-part of an analysis 
pipeline, so no article-data will be stored locally. This 
tool is not mean to be used to gather and store 
information; it should only be used for analysis.
