This is an interface to several (currently only two) APIs for retrieving news data.
The data is returned in a standardized json-format, after simple text cleaning.
This makes it possible to analyze data from diverse sources in a single framework.
See https://github.com/Peder2911/Diverse_Folio_Isle for an example on how this can be done.

Usage:
./getArticles.py {query}
This returns the json-formatted articles to stdout.
The query formatting is specific to each source, see f.ex:
https://developer.nytimes.com/article_search_v2.json#/Documentation/GET/articlesearch.json
